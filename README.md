# CUSTOMER_CHURN_project
Customer churn is a critical business challenge where companies attempt to predict which customers are likely to stop using their product or service. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a customer will churn based on various customer features such as account details, usage patterns, and demographic data.

The project uses real-world datasets, explores different machine learning models, and evaluates their performance. The primary objective is to identify at-risk customers and provide companies with the insights to take preventive measures.

#Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
Churn Prediction: Predicts customer churn based on features like account tenure, service usage, and payment methods.
Model Deployment: Model saved using joblib and pickle for future predictions on new data.

#Results
After training and evaluating the models, the best model (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost) is selected. The model is evaluated using:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
AUC-ROC curve

#this project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn. By identifying high-risk customers, businesses can take proactive actions, such as offering personalized retention strategies, improving customer service, or providing targeted discounts. With the right data and tools, predicting churn can significantly improve customer retention and reduce business losses.
